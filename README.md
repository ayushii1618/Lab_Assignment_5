SciPy & NumPy Basic Operations

This repository demonstrates fundamental operations using NumPy and SciPy, popular Python libraries for scientific computing and linear algebra. The scripts provide practical examples of array manipulation, matrix computations, and sparse matrix handling.
The project includes creating and saving a 4x4 array of ones to a text file and reading it back. It calculates cubic roots of numbers using NumPy’s functions and performs matrix operations such as determinant calculation, inversion, and finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors with SciPy’s linear algebra tools. Additionally, it showcases the creation and manipulation of sparse matrices, including addition, multiplication, and transposition using SciPy’s sparse package.
To run the code, ensure Python is installed along with NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib.
